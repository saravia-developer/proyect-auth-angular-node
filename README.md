## Hello Developer

I created this project in order to practice my mastery of Angular, Node and Docker technologies. I hope you like it ðŸ˜€

The way to get the entire project up and running is by entering the following command in your terminal:

```sh
sh start.sh
```

Enjoy this project that contains authorization and authentication of an app in which a table will be shown if you enter an Excel, CSV or JSON file in the format requested by the app.
